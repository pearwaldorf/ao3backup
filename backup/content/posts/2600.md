![Rodney's never been one for the post-it notes, because it takes more time to write things down than it does to type them up. Long hand is just not something he does anymore.](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2436187/homesickness/p01.JPG "Rodney's never been one for the post-it notes, because it takes more time to write things down than it does to type them up.
